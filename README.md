This is a habit tracker (clearly) mixed with anime rng and fun to keep you motivated.
It is built on a trust system that you manager you points well (It is recommended to scale tasks
from 1 - 20 HWP depending on the task).

HOW DOES IT WORK?

1. Double Click on "Anime Habit Tracker"

2. In the "Tasks" section, write down a task in the "Task name" Bar. Then set the "HWP" 
(Hard Work Points) For the task. (It is recommended to use 1-10 for most tasks.

3. In the "Characters" section you may select a anime series and then a character to earn XP.
You begin with "Naruto" as your first anime character.

4. If you go to the "Wheel" section, you may use your "HWP" to roll for more characters. When rolled,
you may go to the "Characters" section again and select the new anime character by clicking them.

5. Repeat as you do tasks and when you're done for the day delete your tasks and download a new save.
Make sure you always "import save" before starting your day. Also, make sure to delete your past saves
to avoid confusion (or rename them).

FUTURE STUFF...

I plan to add new series, characters, rewards, etc. It will just take a bit of time to do.

Have fun and work hard, God bless.
