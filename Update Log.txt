EXTRA INFO

HUGE UPDATE... It may not look like much on the surface but doing task's will feel a lot more
rewarding now. We get PFP's, Achievements, etc. Which makes going for characters 
(atleast for me) worth it. I hope yall like this update if you try it. Also, let me know if you find any bugs
or what anime to add in the future

Work hard and God bless
